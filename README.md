# GUSMap Version 0.1.1

Genotyping Uncertainty with Sequencing data and linkage MAPping (GUSMap).

An R package for constructing genetic linkage maps using low and/or high coverage sequencing data without requiring filtering with respect to read depth. It accounts for errors associated with low sequencing depth and miscalled bases. This release accompanies the paper by Bilton et al. (2018).

### Installation:

The easiest way to install GUSMap in R is using the devtools package.

```
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("tpbilton/GUSMap")
```

Note: Some of the functions are coded in C and therefore an appropriate C compiler is needed for the package to work. For windows OS, Rtools (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) provides a compiler. 

### Reading Data into GUSMap:

The format of the data required by GUSMap is a matrix of allele counts for the reference and alternate allele and segregation type of each SNP. This data can obtained from a VCF in GUSMap using a couple of key functions. There are three steps in this process which are the following:

1. The VCF file needs to be converted into RA (reference/alternate) format using the function `VCFtoRA()`. The following example (using the chromosome 11 SNPs of the Manuka dataset used by Bilton et al. (2018)) shows how this is done in GUSMap.
 
   ```
   library(GUSMap)
   MKfile <- Manuka11()
   RAfile <- VCFtoRA(MKfile$vcf)
   ```

   The function `Manuka11()` just returns the path to the chromosome 11 SNPs in the Manuka data set that comes with the package. The function `VCFtoRA()` creates two files, an RA file and a partially completed pedigree file (we shall touch on this file later). More information about the `VCFtoRA()` function and RA format data is available using the following command.

   ```
   ?VCFtoRA
   ```

   In order to convert the VCF file to RA format, some information regarding allelic depth is required. Specifically, one of the fields 'AD', 'RO' and 'AO', or 'DP4' needs to be 
supplied in the VCF file.

2. The pedigree file created from `VCFtoRA()` is in the form of

   |SampleID |IndividualID | Mother | Father | Family |
   | ------- | ----------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
   |P1_S1    |             |        |        |        |
   |P1_S2    |             |        |        |        |
   |P2_S1    |             |        |        |        |
   |P2_S2    |             |        |        |        | 
   |O1       |             |        |        |        |
   |O2       |             |        |        |        |
   | ...     |             |        |        |        |
   |O177     |             |        |        |        |

   The SampleID column is the sample ID used in the VCF to represent each sample. For the Manuka data set, there are 177 offspring (which are denoted O1 to O177), while the samples P1_S1 and P1_S2 are two samples of one parent and P2_S1 and P2_S2 are two samples of the other parent. The IndividualID column is used to denote the individual to which each sample belongs, where each individual must have a unique identifier. This is useful as it allows us to have multiple samples on the same individual. The Mother column is used to specify which individual is the mother of that individual (and likewise the father column). Note that if the Mother or Father is unknown, then the entry in these columns should be left blank. The Family column is just used to allow the user to specify a name for each specific family.

   For our Manuka dataset, a completed pedigree file should look like the following:

   |SampleID | IndividualID | Mother | Father | Family |
   | ------- | ------------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
   |P1_S1    |  1           |        |        |        |
   |P1_S2    |  1           |        |        |        |
   |P2_S1    |  2           |        |        |        | 
   |P2_S2    |  2           |        |        |        |
   |O1       |  3           | 2      | 1      | Manuka | 
   |O2       |  4           | 2      | 1      | Manuka | 
   | ...     | ...          | ...    | ...    | ...    |
   |O177     | 179          | 2      | 1      | Manuka | 
   
   Note that a correct pedigree file is located in the package and the path to this file is:
   
   ```
   MKdata$ped
   ```

3. The final step is to read in and process the RA data. For the Manuka example, the relavent code is the following:

   ```
   MKdata <- readRA(RAfile, pedfile=MKfile$ped)
   ```

   The function `readRA()` processes the RA data file and extract list with the required data.

   ```
   str(MKdata)
   ```

   From the output, one can see that the object MKdata is a list with various components, which can be accessed as follows.

   ```
   MKdata$depth_Ref
   ```

### Analysis in GUSMap:

To show how GUSMap is used to estimate the adjacent recombination fractions, we use the low depth (average read depth below 6) chromosome 11 SNPs from the Manuka data set described in Bilton et al. (2018). First, it was noted that there were a number of SNPs that were erroreously placed on the chromsome. The following code gives the indices of these SNPs.
```
## Remove the bad SNPs
badSnps <- rep(FALSE, ncol(MKdata$genon[[1]])) 
badSnps[c(3:14,16,18:23,25:27,29,33:35,39:42,44,46:49, 
   53,58:60,63,65:67,69:74,76,77,85,104,114:129, 
   152,162,163,173:180,187:190,206:208,210,212,213, 
   216,228,272,285,286,298,304,314,318,320,342,344,345, 
   354,358,370,373,380,389,390,397,408,411,421,427, 
   437,446,469,493,498:500,506,510,516,519,522,531, 
   543,553,556,569,582,585,601,617,620,623,628,635, 
   636:643,647:650,669:680)] <- TRUE 
```
We now perform the analysis using the low depth data. To extract these SNPs, we use the code,
```
## Save the data into objects for convenience
depth_Ref <- MKdata$depth_Ref[[1]]
depth_Alt <- MKdata$depth_Alt[[1]]
config <- MKdata$config[[1]]
## Vector giving the indices of the good low depth SNPs
ind_rd6 <- which(colMeans(depth_Ref + depth_Alt,na.rm=T ) < 6 & !badSnps) 
```
Given the order of these SNPs, the parental phase (or OPGPs) can be infered using the function `infer_OPGP_FS`.
```
OPGP_rd6 <- infer_OPGP_FS(depth_Ref[,ind_rd6], depth_Alt[,ind_rd6], 
                          config[ind_rd6], epsilon=0.001, reltol=1e-3) 
```
Once the OPGPs have been correctly inferred, the adjacent recombination fractions can be estimated using the function `rf_est_FS()`.
```
rf_est <- rf_est_FS(depth_Ref=list(depth_Ref[,ind_rd6]), 
                    depth_Alt=list(depth_Alt[,ind_rd6]), 
                    OPGP=list(OPGP_rd6)) 
```
The recombination fraction estimates can be extract using,
```
rf_est$rf
```
and the estimate of the sequencing error rate can be extract using,
```
rf_est$epsilon
```
while the value of the log-likelihood can be extract using,
```
rf_est$loglik
```
Once the recombination fractions have been estimated, they can be written to a file as follows.
```
write(rf_est$rf, file="Manuka_chr11_rd6_rf.txt", ncolumns=1)
```
To estimate sex-specific recombination fractions, the `sexSpec` argument needs to be set as `TRUE`.
```
rf_est_ss <- rf_est_FS(depth_Ref=list(depth_Ref[,ind_rd6]), 
                      depth_Alt=list(depth_Alt[,ind_rd6]), 
                      OPGP=list(OPGP_rd6), sexSpec=T) 
```
