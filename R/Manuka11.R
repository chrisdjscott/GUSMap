### R Function for reading in the Manuka data of chromosome 11.
### Author: Timothy Bilton
### Date: 6/02/18

## Wrapper function for reading in the Manuka data set for chromosome 11
#' Manuka chromosome 11 SNPs and pedigree file
#' 
#' Function for extracting the path to the (VCF) file of the Manuka data used in the publication by Bilton et
#' al. (2017) and a pedigree file that goes with the data.
#' 
#' The data consists of 680 SNPs, genotyped using genotyping-by-sequencing
#' methods. The data is in VCF format (see this \href{https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf}{page} 
#' for specification of VCF format). The pedigree file contains five columns, namely
#' \itemize{
#' \item SampleID: A unique character string of the sample ID. These correspond to those found in the VCF file
#' \item IndividualID: A character giving the ID number of the individual for which the sample corresponds to.
#' Note that some samples can be from the same individual. 
#' \item Mother: The ID of the mother as given in the IndividualID. Note, if the mother is unknown then this should be left blank.
#' \item Father: The ID of the father as given in the IndividualID. Note, if the father is unknown then this should be left blank.
#' \item Family: The name of the Family for a group of progeny with the same parents. Note that this is not necessary but if
#' given must be the same for all the progeny.
#' }
#' 
#' @return Function outputs a character string of the complete path to the manuka data set contained in the package
#' and a pedigree file that goes with the data.
